## Continuous Energy Market for flexibility using renewable energy
This project was made in python and was created for my thesis in my final year as an electrical engineer student. The purpose of this code is to run a continuous market to provide flexibility to the users while it respects the network constraints (the network is checked with the PTDF coefficients)
