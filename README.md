## Continuous Energy Market for flexibility using renewable energy
This project was made in python and was created for my thesis in my final year as an electrical engineer student. The purpose of this code is to run a continuous market to provide flexibility to the users while it respects the network constraints (the network is checked with the PTDF coefficients)

##

## Power data.xlsx
We ran the market for 6 different hours in a day. Those 6 different hours represent states at which the network may face challenges, To find these 6 hours we calcualted the load, production and net load of each hour based on real time data of consumption and renewable energy production. 

The six hours that are tested are:

3: min load
4: min net load
12: max load
13: max production
19: max net load
21: min production

Also, in this file are the calculations for the power at each node
